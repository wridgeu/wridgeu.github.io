	/**
	 * `FetchInterceptor` overrides the native `Fetch API` and provides
	 * convenient hooks to instrument the request and response lifecycles.
	 *
	 * The interceptor is designed to be an equivalent of the `XHRInterceptor`:
	 * like the XHR overrides, its hooks are called <b>synchronously</b> for the
	 * request phase and in a <b>fire-and-forget</b> manner for the response
	 * phase. In no case does a registered hook delay the promise the caller of
	 * `fetch()` awaits — the interceptor must never slow down the productive
	 * request/response, it only observes and (for the request) synchronously
	 * enriches it.
	 *
	 * ## Request
	 * - **`onRequest(request: Request): Request`**
	 *   Called synchronously after a `Request` instance is created, immediately
	 *   before the native `Fetch API` is invoked. It may return a modified
	 *   `Request` instance, which is passed to subsequent `onRequest` hooks and
	 *   used by the native `Fetch API`. Anything that influences the request MUST
	 *   happen synchronously in the hook — a returned promise is not awaited and
	 *   does not affect the request. If the hook throws, the error is logged and
	 *   the request is sent unchanged: an instrumentation hook must never break
	 *   the productive request.
	 *
	 * ## Response
	 * - **`onResponse(response: Response, request: Request): void`**
	 *   Called once the response body has been fully received (the equivalent
	 *   of XHR `readyState === 4`), so that the `PerformanceResourceTiming`
	 *   entry is guaranteed to exist. The hook receives its own independent
	 *   clone of the response and the originating request, and may consume the
	 *   response body freely (`text()`, `json()`, `blob()`, …) without affecting
	 *   the caller's response or other hooks. The hook is fire-and-forget: it
	 *   never delays the promise the caller of `fetch()` awaits. A returned
	 *   value is ignored.
	 * - **`onResponseError(error: any, request: Request): void`**
	 *   Called fire-and-forget when the native `Fetch API` call rejects. Receives
	 *   the error and the originating request. Does not rethrow — the original
	 *   rejection is always propagated to the caller.
	 *

	 * @since 1.152

	 * clone is drained via arrayBuffer() to detect body completion — the equivalent of
	 * XHR readyState === 4, which guarantees the PerformanceResourceTiming entry exists.
	 * If that body read fails (e.g. the connection drops mid-body), the terminal state is
	 * routed to the onResponseError hooks instead — onResponse cannot be called because its
	 * "body fully received" contract cannot be honoured, and swallowing the failure would
