mainText=Hey there! My name is Marco and this is a demo page where I practice a few UI5/Web Development specific things. It has a bit of information about me here and there. To learn more just follow me on one of the social media sites linked above. \n Any feedback is very much appreciated as I'm not a 'real' UI5 developer in my current working position but mostly learn about it in my spare time. There are other topics like CAP (Cloud in general), CDS, OData and so forth that also highly interest me. \n\n A Short description of myself would be: 'Jack of all trades - but master of none'.
