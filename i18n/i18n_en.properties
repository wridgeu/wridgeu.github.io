introText=Dedicated ABAP developer that also takes great interest in exploring things beyond my known field of work.
mainText=Hey there! My name is Marco and this is a demo page where I practice a few UI5/Web Development specific things. It has a bit of information about me here and there. To learn more just follow me on one of the socials linked above.\n\n Any feedback is very much appreciated. Starting out as ABAP developer I've grown to become a Full-Stack developer over time. Currently I find myself in the position of an UI5 Architect. There are other topics like RAP, CAP (Cloud in general), CDS, OData and so on, that also highly interest me. \n\n A Short description of myself would be: 'Jack of all trades, master of none'.
ui5conintroduction=In 2022 I\'ve had the opportunity to speak at the UI5Con Panelist Discussion. \n Together with Peter Muessig, Volker Buzek, Marian Zeis, Nitish Mehta and Jakob Kjaer, \n we talked about various things within the UI5 Community. \n Below you can find a few images from that session. \n\n \ud83d\udcf8 by Dirk Becker and the OpenUI5 Team
